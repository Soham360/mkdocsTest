The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) was established as one of the nation’s first supercomputer centers under a cooperative agreement by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in collaboration with UC San Diego and General Atomics (GA) Technologies. SDSC first opened its doors on November 14, 1985.

For more than 35 years, it has grown and stewarded its national reputation as a pioneer and leader in high-performance and data-intensive computing and cyberinfrastructure. Located on the campus of UC San Diego, SDSC provides resources, services and expertise to the national research community including industry and academia.

Cyberinfrastructure refers to an accessible, integrated network of computer-based resources and expertise, focused on accelerating scientific inquiry and discovery. With Voyager and Expanse, SDSC’s latest supercomputing resources, the center supports hundreds of multidisciplinary programs spanning a wide range of science themes—from earth sciences and biology to astrophysics, bioinformatics and health IT.

SDSC participates in Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS) and was a partner in eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), two of the most advanced collections of integrated digital resources and services in the world.
